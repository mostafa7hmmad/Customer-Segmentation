![Customer Segmentation](1.jpg)

## Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a dataset containing two main features: `Income` and `Spending Score` (ranging from 1 to 100).

## Steps Undertaken:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Initial exploration to understand data distribution and relationships.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Data cleaning and preparation.
   - Label encoding where necessary.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers.
   - Visualized the data with scatter plots before and after clustering to illustrate the segmentation.

4. **Results:**
   - Assigned cluster labels to the dataset for further analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which contains customer data including Age, Gender, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

## Purpose
This segmentation helps in identifying customer groups based on their income and spending patterns, aiding in targeted marketing strategies.
